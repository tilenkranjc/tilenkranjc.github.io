I was always interested in how scientists communicate their work, be it a conference talk, a poster, a paper or simply an informal conversation. Each of these communication channels have a different purpose. For example, conference talks and papers are intended to disseminate results, while posters are more a *networking* tool. 

**This lead me to develop my own communication skills. I started drawing my own diagrams and figures. So, I'm showcasing some of my work in the gallery below.**
