Welcome to my website.

I am a bioinformatician, an entrepreneur and a coder. My day job is at Biosistemika, my night job is freelancing, my free time job is being a dad. 

Data science, visualisation and communication has been always my passion. 

I particularly enjoy [analysis](research/) of biological data. My speciality is biological and medical image analysis. 

If you feel you could use my help, feel free to [get in touch](contact/)!
